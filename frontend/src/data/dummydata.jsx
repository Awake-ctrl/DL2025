    desc: "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have transformed computer vision by learning hierarchical features from images. This project aims to visualize the activations of CNN layers, where early layers detect edges and textures, and deeper layers recognize complex features. Techniques like Grad-CAM are also employed to highlight regions contributing to predictions. These visualizations offer valuable insights into how CNNs interpret and process images, making deep learning models more explainable and interpretable.",
